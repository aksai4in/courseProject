**Game Idea**
We would like to develop a single-player role-playing game in which the player will be the adventurer with the final goal of defeating the dragon. There are several roles available for the player to choose from and each of them comes with different strengths and weaknesses. For example, a warrior has more health points and high damage points yet rarely triggers critical strikes. Along the journey, depending on the player’s actions, a series of random events will happen and the player will encounter villagers, knights, monsters, etc. The player can choose to interact with them. Different actions will in turn affect the development of the following story. After defeating enemies, the player will obtain ability points that can be used to upgrade the strengths. The mission of the player is to collect as many points as possible along the journey and figure out the way leading to the dragon to defeat it. There are several endings. Depending on the player’s actions, the journey will lead to different endings.

**Game Features**
Several roles with different strengths and weaknesses for the player to choose from
  Data structures for storing game status:
  Data structure storing the attributes of different roles will be developed and available for the player to choose from

Random story development depending on the player's actions
  Generation of random game sets or events:
  Every gameplay will have a different starting point. Throughout the player’s journey, the story would also unfold differently and randomly partly depending on the     player’s action, and the player might also randomly encounter other characters, which would, in turn, influence the following story.

Program codes in multiple files:
The whole story consists of different chapters, and each chapter would be programmed within an independent file. Depending on the player’s actions and the story development, different chapters would be called partly randomly to become a part of the player’s story.

Saving game/ Loading from the previous game
  File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status):
  The player can choose to save the game and load the game to continue the previous gameplay. When facing a tough decision to be made in the story, the player can also   choose to save the game before making the decision and load the game and make the decision again if the previous choice doesn’t lead to a good ending.

Ability point system for the player to upgrade the strengths
  Data structures for storing game status:
  Built upon the initial strengths and weaknesses, the player can obtain ability points along the journey and distribute them to upgrade the strengths

Different characters to interact with the player
  Program codes in multiple files:
  Depending on the player’s actions, the player will encounter different characters to interact with along the journey. Codes of different characters’ actions and       dialogues with the player will be stored in independent files and called randomly depending on the player’s actions and story development.
